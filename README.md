Recipes web project

This project will list a series of recipes as web pages.

This includes an index page and seperate directories for recipe pages and images.

I created a template .html file based on the first recipe to speed up writing the webpage. This file also includes some comment text instructing other authors on how to fill in the code and how it is structured.

Several images (none taken of actual dishes I cooked) are included, as well as other links for reference and context in addition to the informaiton in each recipe.
